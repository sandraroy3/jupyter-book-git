Equation is $f(x) = y^2$

## Equations in Jupyter
Jupyter uses Latex based formatting for equations.

Example:
    
The quadratic equation : $A*x^2 + B*x + C = 0 $

The solution is :
$$x = \frac{-B \pm \sqrt{B^2 - 4AC}}{2A}$$

## Schrodinger wave equation
The equation of motion of quantum mechanics for a particle is given by the Schr√∂dinger equation
$$ i \hbar \frac{\partial}{\partial t}\Psi(\mathbf{r},t) = \hat H \Psi(\mathbf{r},t) $$

$${\displaystyle i\hbar {\frac {\partial }{\partial t}}\Psi (\mathbf {r} ,t) + {\frac {\hbar ^{2}}{2m}}\nabla ^{2}\Psi (\mathbf {r} ,t)} = V(\mathbf {r} )\Psi (\mathbf {r} ,t).$$

where $\Psi$  (the Greek letter psi) is the state vector of the quantum system, t is time..
