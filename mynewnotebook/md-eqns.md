## Equations in Jupyter
Jupyter uses Latex based formatting for equations.

Example:
    
The quadratic equation : $Ax^2 + Bx + C = 0 $

The solution is :
$ x = \frac{-B \pm \sqrt{B^2 - 4AC}}{2A} $

## Schrodinger wave equation
The equation of motion of quantum mechanics for a particle is given by the Schr√∂dinger equation
$$ {i \hbar \frac{\partial}{\partial t}\Psi(\mathbf{r},t) } = \hat H \Psi(\mathbf{r},t)  $$

$${\displaystyle i\hbar {\frac {\partial }{\partial t}}\Psi (\mathbf {r} ,t) + {\frac {\hbar ^{2}}{2m}}\nabla ^{2}\Psi (\mathbf {r} ,t)} = V(\mathbf {r} )\Psi (\mathbf {r} ,t).$$

Here, ${\displaystyle \Psi (x,t)}$ is a wave function, a function that assigns a complex number to each point $x$ at each time ${t}$. The parameter ${m}$ is the mass of the particle, and ${V(x,t)}$ is the potential that represents the environment in which the particle exists. The constant $i$ is the imaginary unit, and ${\hbar}$  is the reduced Planck constant, which has units of action (energy multiplied by time).
